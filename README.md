# Unity Open Project #1

Welcome! This is the repository for the first Unity **Open Project**, an initiative where Unity and the community collaborate together to create **a small game**, in an open source way. As of now the game is still unnamed so we just refer to it as *Open Project #1*.

## Follow the progress
The [dedicated sub-forum](https://forum.unity.com/forums/open-projects.531/) on the Unity Forums is where the Unity team and the whole community discuss and brainstorm ideas.

The [public roadmap](https://open.codecks.io/unity-open-project-1) is the central location to know what's coming to the game. Also a great way to find something to contribute on!  

## Contribute
We would love to get your contributions into the game! Whether you create code, art, narrative, sounds; whether you feel you are experienced enough or not; there is probably something you can add to it.

To learn all about contributing, head to the [Contribution Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PwBF4yQl69RxvVHZ2m2iiy5pYjd9QO-VcuXWDjB7QwA/edit#).  
⚠ Please **create a thread [on the forum](https://forum.unity.com/forums/open-projects.531/) there before starting to work on big contributions!** 

If you feel like taking on some **bugs**, check out the [Issues page](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/open-project-1/issues) on this very repo. In fact, another thing you could help with is by doing some **QA testing**: download the [latest release](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/open-project-1/releases) of the game, play it, and report issues in the appropriate page. That's also a great way to be part of this project!

This project is built on **Unity 2019.4 LTS**, whatever latest patch is available.

## Play the game
Just want to try the game out? Head to the [release page](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/open-project-1/releases) and grab the latest version.
